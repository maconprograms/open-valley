Warren is a small Vermont town of approximately 1,800 residents nestled in the Mad River Valley. It's home to Sugarbush Resort, covered bridges, and some of the best skiing on the East Coast. But beneath its picturesque surface lies a stark reality.

**Only about 1 in 3 dwellings in Warren is someone's primary residence.**

This ratio is among the most extreme in Vermont, where the statewide average for second homes is 17%.

## Why This Matters

When most dwellings sit empty most of the year, it affects everything:

**Schools**: Fewer children means smaller class sizes, which sounds positive until you realize it threatens program viability.

**Emergency Services**: Volunteer fire departments depend on year-round residents who can respond during the day. Seasonal homeowners are in Boston or New York when the alarm sounds.

**Local Business**: Restaurants and shops survive on tourism but struggle in shoulder seasons. Workers who might fill these jobs can't find year-round housing.

**Community Character**: Town Meeting participation declines. The people making decisions about Warren's future increasingly don't live there.

## The Sugarbush Effect

Warren's second-home count isn't driven by wealthy mansion owners. It's driven by condos.

Hundreds of small Sugarbush condos averaging $65,000 in assessed value make ski getaways accessible to middle-class families. But there are so many that they dominate the housing landscape.

**Average Property Values:**
- Primary residences: ~$350,000
- Second homes: ~$170,000 (pulled down by small condos)

The counterintuitive finding: second homes have the *lowest* average value in Warren.

## What Open Valley Does

This project opens up Warren's housing data so residents, policymakers, and the Planning Commission can understand:

- How many dwellings exist and where
- Which are primary residences vs. second homes vs. STRs
- How ownership patterns are changing over time

We use Vermont's Act 73 framework to classify properties, combining public Grand List data with STR listings and property transfers.

## The 2028 Baseline

Starting in 2028, Vermont will require annual Dwelling Use Attestations from property owners. For the first time, we'll have verified data on how each dwelling is actually used.

Warren's current ratio is a starting point, not an ending point. What happens next depends on the policies Vermont chooses and the choices property owners make.
