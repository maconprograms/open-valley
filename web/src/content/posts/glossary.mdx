# Glossary of Terms

Vermont's Act 73 (2025) created the state's first systematic framework for classifying residential properties. This glossary explains the terms we use and how they connect to Act 73's definitions.

## The Core Question

Everything in our data model centers on one question:

> **Does someone live here full-time?**

This single question determines whether a dwelling adds to Warren's housing supply or sits outside it. A town where only 20% of dwellings house year-round residents faces different challenges than one where 80% do.

## Land & Property

### Parcel

A discrete piece of land identified by a unique **SPAN** (School Property Account Number).

- Each parcel has a unique 13-character SPAN (e.g., "617-208-10293")
- Contains address, acreage, and assessed value
- One parcel can contain multiple dwellings
- **Source**: Vermont Grand List

Warren has **1,823 parcels**.

### Dwelling

A housing unit fit for year-round habitation. Act 73 defines a dwelling as:

> A building or part of a building with separate entrance, designed for occupancy by one or more persons, providing living facilities for sleeping, cooking, and sanitary needs, and fit for year-round habitation.

**Requirements** (all must be met):
- Separate entrance (its own ingress/egress)
- Sleeping facilities
- Cooking facilities
- Sanitary facilities (bathroom)
- Year-round habitable (insulated, heated)

**What IS a dwelling**: Single-family home, condo, apartment (1-4 units), ADU, mobile home, townhouse

**What is NOT a dwelling**: Seasonal camp without winterization, hotel room, 5+ unit building (classified differently)

Warren has **2,175 dwellings** across 1,823 parcels (some parcels have multiple units).

## Occupancy: Who Lives Here?

### DwellingUse

The primary way we classify dwellings is by **occupancy pattern** - does someone live here year-round?

| DwellingUse | What it means | In housing supply? |
|-------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **FULL_TIME_RESIDENCE** | Someone lives here year-round (owner or tenant) | Yes |
| **SHORT_TERM_RENTAL** | Primarily used for visitors (under 30 day stays) | No |
| **SECOND_HOME** | Owner visits occasionally, sits empty otherwise | No |
| **VACANT** | Year-round habitable but empty | No |

### is_owner_occupied

For dwellings where someone lives full-time, we track whether it's the **owner** or a **tenant**:

- `is_owner_occupied = true` → Owner lives here
- `is_owner_occupied = false` → Tenant lives here (long-term rental)

This distinction matters for tax classification.

## STR Listings: Separate Data

**Key insight**: STR listings are data about rental activity, not a dwelling classification.

Any dwelling can have an Airbnb or VRBO listing attached. The listing doesn't change the dwelling's primary use:

| DwellingUse | Has STR Listing? | What it means |
|-------------|------------------|---------------|
| FULL_TIME_RESIDENCE | Yes | Homeowner occasionally rents (holidays, ski week) |
| FULL_TIME_RESIDENCE | No | Just lives there |
| SHORT_TERM_RENTAL | Yes | Dedicated STR - this IS the primary use |
| SECOND_HOME | Yes | Rented when owner not visiting |
| SECOND_HOME | No | Just sits empty |

**Example**: A family lists their Warren home on Airbnb for 2 weeks over holidays:
- `use = FULL_TIME_RESIDENCE` (they live here)
- `is_owner_occupied = true` (owner lives here)
- `has_str_listing = true` (they have a listing)
- Tax classification → **HOMESTEAD** (owner lives here 6+ months)

Warren has **605 STR listings** from Airbnb and VRBO.

## Tax Classifications (Act 73)

Vermont Act 73 creates three tax classifications. These are **derived** from DwellingUse + is_owner_occupied:

### HOMESTEAD

Owner's primary residence for 6+ months per year.

- Must file annual Homestead Declaration by October 15
- Only ONE homestead per person
- LLCs, corporations, and most trusts cannot claim homestead

**In our model**: `FULL_TIME_RESIDENCE` + `is_owner_occupied = true`

### NHS_RESIDENTIAL (Non-Homestead Residential)

Second homes, vacation properties, and short-term rentals (1-4 units).

- Dwellings where no one lives year-round
- Higher tax rate than homestead (rate TBD by Legislature)

**In our model**: `SHORT_TERM_RENTAL`, `SECOND_HOME`, or `VACANT`

### NHS_NONRESIDENTIAL (Non-Homestead Non-Residential)

Commercial properties, long-term rentals, and 5+ unit buildings.

- Includes traditional landlord-tenant rentals
- Highest tax rate (rate TBD)

**In our model**: `FULL_TIME_RESIDENCE` + `is_owner_occupied = false` (tenant lives there)

### Derivation Table

| DwellingUse | is_owner_occupied | Tax Classification |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| FULL_TIME_RESIDENCE | true | HOMESTEAD |
| FULL_TIME_RESIDENCE | false | NHS_NONRESIDENTIAL |
| SHORT_TERM_RENTAL | - | NHS_RESIDENTIAL |
| SECOND_HOME | - | NHS_RESIDENTIAL |
| VACANT | - | NHS_RESIDENTIAL |

## What Does "Full-Time" Mean?

Different policies use different thresholds:

| Policy | Threshold | Meaning |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| **Vermont Homestead** | 6+ months/year (183+ days) | Owner must live here as domicile |
| **Long-term rental** | Rented 30+ days/stay, 6+ months/year | Tenant lives here |
| **Short-term rental** | Stays under 30 days | Visitors, not residents |

We use the **6-month threshold** (183 days) to align with Vermont's homestead definition.

### Signals We Use

| Signal | Source | What it tells us |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| Homestead declaration filed | Grand List | Owner lives here 6+ months |
| Landlord certificate filed | Tax Dept | Tenant lives here |
| Owner mailing = property address | Grand List | Owner likely lives here |
| Owner state ≠ VT | Grand List | Owner lives out of state |
| STR listing matched | AirROI | Dwelling has STR activity |

## Implementation Timeline

Act 73 phases in over several years:

| Date | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| July 2025 | Act 73 signed into law |
| Jan-May 2026 | Legislature defines "dwelling unit" |
| June 2026-2027 | Towns identify all dwelling units |
| Oct 2027 | Tax Dept provides classification data |
| April 2028 | First mandatory Dwelling Use Attestation |
| July 2028 | New tax rates take effect |

## Warren's Current Breakdown

Applying these definitions to Warren:

- **HOMESTEAD**: 431 dwellings (20%)
- **NHS_RESIDENTIAL**: 1,744 dwellings (80%)

This 80/20 split is why Warren's housing situation is unusual - most dwellings don't house year-round residents.
