# Understanding Vermont's Act 73: A New Way to Classify Homes

On July 1, 2025, Governor Phil Scott signed H.454 into law, creating Vermont's most significant property tax reform in decades. Known as Act 73, the law establishes a new framework for classifying residential properties based on how they're actually used - not just their physical characteristics.

This matters because Vermont has never had a systematic way to track second homes. While everyone knows they exist, particularly in ski towns, there's been no official count, no baseline, and no mechanism for policy decisions.

Act 73 changes that.

## The Three Classifications

Under Act 73, every dwelling in Vermont will be assigned one of three classifications:

**HOMESTEAD**
- **Definition**: Owner's domicile for 6+ months per year
- **Tax rate**: Education rate (baseline)
- **Example**: Year-round Warren residents

**NHS_RESIDENTIAL** (Non-Homestead Residential)
- **Definition**: Second homes, vacation properties, and short-term rentals (1-4 units)
- **Tax rate**: Higher rate (to be determined by future Legislatures)
- **Example**: Massachusetts residents who ski at Sugarbush

**NHS_NONRESIDENTIAL** (Non-Homestead Non-Residential)
- **Definition**: Commercial properties, long-term rentals, 5+ unit buildings
- **Tax rate**: Highest rate (to be determined)
- **Example**: Multi-family apartment buildings, commercial rentals

## Critical Definitions

**What counts as a "dwelling"?**

A dwelling is a building (or part of building) with:
- Separate means of ingress and egress (its own entrance)
- Living facilities for sleeping, cooking, and sanitary needs
- Fit for year-round habitation

This matters because accessory dwelling units (ADUs), in-law apartments, and converted garage spaces may each count as separate dwellings requiring their own classification.

**What counts as a "long-term rental"?**

A property qualifies as a long-term rental (NHS_NONRESIDENTIAL) if it's:
- Rented for 30+ days at a time
- For 6+ months of the year

This distinction is important: a short-term rental (Airbnb, VRBO) is NHS_RESIDENTIAL, but a traditional year-lease apartment is NHS_NONRESIDENTIAL.

## Implementation Timeline

- **July 2025**: Act 73 signed into law
- **April 2026**: First Dwelling Use Attestation forms available (voluntary)
- **April 2028**: First mandatory attestation filing deadline
- **2029+**: Longitudinal trend data becomes available

## What the Law Does and Doesn't Do

**It creates classifications but doesn't set rates.**

Act 73 establishes the framework for categorizing properties, but it explicitly leaves the decision about differential tax rates to future Legislatures. This was a political compromise - supporters got the classification system, while opponents avoided immediate tax increases.

**It requires attestation but relies on honor system.**

Property owners will self-report their dwelling's use through annual attestations. While there are penalties for false statements, enforcement relies largely on self-compliance and occasional audits.

**It applies to dwellings, not parcels.**

A single parcel might contain multiple dwellings - a main house and an ADU, for example. Each dwelling is classified separately. This is why Warren has 2,175 dwellings across only 1,823 parcels.

## What This Means for Warren

Applying Act 73 classifications to Warren's housing stock reveals:

- **HOMESTEAD**: 431 dwellings (19.8%)
- **NHS_RESIDENTIAL**: 1,744 dwellings (80.2%)
- **NHS_NONRESIDENTIAL**: ~0 dwellings (currently undercounted)

The NHS_NONRESIDENTIAL category shows zero because current data sources don't distinguish between second homes and long-term rentals. The 2028 attestations will reveal the true breakdown.
