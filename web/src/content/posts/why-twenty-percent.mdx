# Why Only 20% of Warren Homes Are Primary Residences

Warren is a small Vermont town of approximately 1,800 residents nestled in the Mad River Valley. It's home to Sugarbush Resort, covered bridges, and some of the best skiing on the East Coast. But beneath its picturesque surface lies a stark reality that makes Warren a case study for one of Vermont's most pressing policy debates.

**Only 1 in 5 dwellings in Warren is someone's primary residence.**

This ratio is among the most extreme in Vermont, where the statewide average for second homes is 17%. Warren sits at 80%.

## The Numbers Tell the Story

We analyzed 2,175 dwelling units across 1,823 parcels using Vermont Grand List data, homestead exemption filings, and short-term rental listings. Here's what we found:

**By Tax Classification (Act 73 Framework)**

- **HOMESTEAD**: 431 dwellings (19.8%) - Owner's primary residence
- **NHS_RESIDENTIAL**: 1,744 dwellings (80.2%) - Second homes and short-term rentals

When we break this down further by how properties are actually used:

- **Second homes (owner-occupied secondary)**: 1,542 dwellings (70.9%)
- **Primary residences**: 431 dwellings (19.8%)
- **Short-term rentals**: 202 dwellings (9.3%)

## The Sugarbush Effect

Warren's second-home count isn't driven by wealthy mansion owners buying up hillside estates. It's driven by condos.

Of the 1,823 parcels in Warren, 744 are categorized as "other" - mostly Sugarbush condos and resort units with addresses like Spring Fling Road, Hobbit Hill, and Club Sugarbush South Road. These small units average just $65,000 in assessed value, making them accessible to middle-class families looking for a ski getaway.

But there are so many of them that they dominate Warren's housing landscape. Even with low individual values, these second-home parcels represent 40% of the total tax base.

**Average Property Values by Category**

- **Rental properties**: $724,000 (highest - multi-family buildings)
- **Commercial**: $474,000
- **Primary residences**: $354,000
- **Second homes**: $167,000 (lowest - pulled down by small condos)

Here's the counterintuitive finding: second homes have the *lowest* average value in Warren. This is because the "second home" bucket includes hundreds of small condos valued at $50,000-$150,000.

## Why This Matters

When 80% of dwellings sit empty most of the year, it affects everything:

**Schools**: Fewer children means smaller class sizes, which sounds positive until you realize it threatens program viability. Warren Elementary serves a shrinking student population.

**Emergency Services**: Volunteer fire departments and rescue squads depend on year-round residents who can respond during the day. Seasonal homeowners are in Boston or New York when the alarm sounds.

**Local Business**: Restaurants and shops survive on tourism but struggle in shoulder seasons. Workers who might fill these jobs can't find year-round housing.

**Community Character**: Town Meeting participation declines. The people making decisions about Warren's future increasingly don't live there.

## The 2028 Baseline

Starting in 2028, Vermont will require annual Dwelling Use Attestations from all owners of 1-4 unit properties. For the first time, we'll have verified data on how each dwelling is actually used - not just whether a homestead exemption was filed, but whether the property is a second home, a short-term rental, or a long-term rental.

Warren's 20% primary residence rate is a starting point, not an ending point. What happens next depends on the policies Vermont chooses and the choices property owners make.
