# From Parcels to Dwellings: How We Model Warren's Housing

Vermont's Act 73 (2025) classifies properties at the dwelling level, not the parcel level. This distinction matters more than you might think.

A parcel is a piece of land with a single owner. A dwelling is a housing unit within that land. One parcel might contain zero dwellings (vacant land), one dwelling (single-family home), or many dwellings (apartment building, duplex with ADU).

## The Hierarchy

```
PARCELS (1,823 total)
├── Parcels WITH dwellings (1,775)
│   ├── Single-dwelling parcels (~1,400)
│   └── Multi-dwelling parcels (~375)
│                               ↓
│                   DWELLINGS (2,175 total)
│                   ├── HOMESTEAD: 431 (19.8%)
│                   └── NHS_RESIDENTIAL: 1,744 (80.2%)
│
└── Parcels WITHOUT dwellings (48)
    └── Vacant land, commercial lots, etc.
```

The 1,823 parcels expand into 2,175 dwellings - an increase of 352 units. This happens because multi-family parcels (duplexes, triplexes, condo associations) contain multiple dwelling units per parcel.

## Why the Percentages Change

At the parcel level, 24% of Warren properties are primary residences.

At the dwelling level, only 19.8% are primary residences (HOMESTEAD).

The homestead count is nearly identical (433 parcels vs. 431 dwellings), but multi-family parcels add approximately 400 non-homestead dwelling units to the denominator. When you're dividing by a larger number, the percentage drops.

## Data Sources and Layering

We follow a principle: **ground in public data first, then enrich with private data.**

**Layer 1: Parcels (Authoritative Base)**
- Source: Vermont Grand List via Geodata Portal
- Records: 1,823 Warren parcels
- Fields: SPAN (unique ID), address, assessed value, property type, boundaries, homestead status

**Layer 2: Dwellings (Inferred)**
- Source: Computed from Grand List + property descriptions
- Records: 2,175 dwellings
- Logic: Parse DESCPROP field for dwelling count

**Layer 3: STR Listings (Enrichment)**
- Source: AirROI commercial STR data
- Records: 605 Warren listings
- Linkage: Spatial match to parcels via lat/lng centroid

## Classification Logic

For each dwelling, we assign a tax classification based on available signals:

**HOMESTEAD** if:
- Parcel has homestead exemption filed (HSDECL = True)
- This is the primary dwelling on the parcel

**NHS_RESIDENTIAL** if:
- No homestead filed, AND
- Property is 1-4 dwelling units, AND
- Not identifiable as long-term rental

**NHS_NONRESIDENTIAL** if:
- Long-term rental (30+ days, 6+ months/year), OR
- 5+ dwelling units, OR
- Commercial/mixed use

Currently, we cannot reliably detect NHS_NONRESIDENTIAL because there's no data source distinguishing second homes from long-term rentals. The 2028 attestations will fill this gap.

## The Medallion Architecture

We organize data processing in layers:

**Bronze (Raw)**: Data as received
- Property Transfer Tax Returns
- STR listings

**Silver (Validated)**: Cleaned, linked to parcels
- Validated PTTR records
- STR listings with 96% match rate

**Gold (Analytical)**: Aggregated, ready for visualization
- 2,175 dwelling classifications
- Summary statistics, breakdowns

## What 2028 Will Enable

The current model relies on inference and imputation. Starting with 2028 attestations, we'll have verified ground truth:

- Owners will self-report dwelling use
- Long-term rentals will be distinguishable from second homes
- ADUs will be captured
- Year-over-year comparisons become possible
