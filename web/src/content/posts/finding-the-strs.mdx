# Finding the STRs: Matching 605 Listings to Warren Parcels

Everyone knows short-term rentals exist in Warren. Walk down Main Street during ski season and half the cars have out-of-state plates. But *which* properties are operating as Airbnbs? How many are there? And what does that mean for housing availability?

We set out to answer these questions by matching commercial STR listing data to Warren's official parcel records. Here's what we found.

## The Data Source

We obtained STR listing data from AirROI, a commercial service that aggregates Airbnb and VRBO listings with geographic coordinates. For the Mad River Valley, this dataset includes:

- **1,054 total listings** across the valley
- **605 listings** in Warren specifically
- **Key fields**: listing ID, platform, lat/lng, bedrooms, nightly rate, host info

## The Matching Problem

AirROI provides coordinates for each listing, but these don't correspond directly to property records. A listing at coordinates (44.1234, -72.8765) might be:

- A house whose official parcel centroid is 50 meters away
- A condo in a building with multiple units at similar coordinates
- A listing with deliberately offset coordinates for privacy

We needed to link each listing to a specific parcel in the Vermont Grand List.

## Our Methodology

**Step 1: Spatial Proximity Match**

For each STR listing, find the nearest parcel centroid within 100 meters.

**Step 2: Confidence Scoring**

Matches within 25 meters get high confidence (0.75-1.0). Matches at 50-100 meters get medium confidence (0.5-0.75). We flag anything over 75 meters for manual review.

**Step 3: Calibration Validation**

We tested our matching against properties where we knew ground truth.

## Match Results

**Overall Match Rate: 96%**

- 583 of 605 listings matched to Warren parcels
- 22 listings unmatched (coordinates outside Warren or too far from any parcel)

**Parcel Coverage:**

- 202 unique parcels have at least one STR listing
- Some parcels have multiple listings (multi-unit buildings)
- 202 dwellings (9.3% of 2,175 total) operate as STRs

## What We Found

**STRs Cluster Around Sugarbush**

The highest density of STR listings appears along Sugarbush Access Road and German Flats Road - the routes leading to the resort.

**Average Nightly Rate: $285**

Warren STRs charge between $75 and $800 per night, with a median around $250. Larger properties (4+ bedrooms) command premium rates during ski season.

**Bedroom Distribution:**

- 1 bedroom: 89 listings (15%)
- 2 bedrooms: 178 listings (30%)
- 3 bedrooms: 201 listings (34%)
- 4+ bedrooms: 118 listings (20%)

**Host Concentration:**

The top 10 hosts control 47 listings (8% of Warren's STR inventory). These are likely property management companies rather than individual homeowners.

## What This Means for Housing

The 202 dwellings operating as STRs represent 9.3% of Warren's housing stock. If these units were instead available for long-term rental, they could potentially house workers serving the resort economy.

However, the counterfactual isn't simple:

- Many STRs are second homes that would otherwise sit vacant
- Some owners use STR income to afford their mortgage
- Banning STRs might reduce tourism revenue without adding housing

What we can say with confidence: 202 dwellings are currently dedicated to short-term tourism use.

## Connecting to Act 73

Under Vermont's new Act 73 framework, STRs are classified as NHS_RESIDENTIAL (Non-Homestead Residential) - the same category as second homes. They may eventually face higher tax rates than primary residences.

Our parcel-level matching enables tracking which specific properties are operating as STRs and how their classification might change under different policy scenarios.
