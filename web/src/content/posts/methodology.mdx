Vermont's Act 73 classifies properties at the **dwelling** level, not the parcel level. A parcel is land. A dwelling is a home. One parcel might have zero dwellings (vacant land), one (single-family home), or many (condo building).

## The Core Principle

**Start with zero. Add only what we can prove.**

We don't assume every parcel has a dwelling. We only create a dwelling record when we have concrete evidence one exists. This prevents counting barns, garages, and sheds as homes.

## The Signal Hierarchy

We check for evidence in priority order:

| Signal | Source | Confidence |
|--------|--------|------------|
| DESCPROP contains "& DWL" | Grand List | 95% |
| Homestead filed | Tax records | 95% |
| Housesite value > $0 | Grand List | 85% |
| STR listing exists | AirROI | 80% |

If none of these signals exist, we don't create a dwelling.

### What Each Signal Means

**DESCPROP** - The Grand List's property description field. When it says "& DWL", that's the assessor documenting a dwelling exists. Examples: `"7.37 ACRES & DWL"` → 1 dwelling, `"2.5 ACRES & 2 DWLS"` → 2 dwellings.

**Homestead filed** - Owner attests under penalty of perjury they live there. If someone lives there, a dwelling exists.

**Housesite value** - Vermont assessors separate land value from home site value. If housesite > $0, the tax department recognizes a habitable structure.

**STR listing** - If it's on Airbnb, someone's renting it. You can't rent what isn't habitable.

### What We Don't Count

These are **not enough** on their own:
- Assessed building value > $0 (could be a barn)
- Property type = "residential" (zoning doesn't guarantee a dwelling)
- CAT code R1/R2 (often inconsistent with DESCPROP)

## Data Layers

**Layer 1: Parcels**
- Source: Vermont Grand List
- What: Land ownership records with SPAN, address, value, boundaries

**Layer 2: Dwellings**
- Source: Inferred from positive signals above
- What: Habitable units linked to parcels

**Layer 3: STR Listings**
- Source: AirROI (Airbnb/VRBO aggregator)
- What: Active rental listings matched to parcels by location

## Classification Logic

Once we identify a dwelling, we classify it per Act 73:

**HOMESTEAD** - Owner's primary residence (6+ months/year). Must have homestead declaration filed.

**NHS_RESIDENTIAL** - Second homes, vacation properties, short-term rentals. No one lives here year-round.

**NHS_NONRESIDENTIAL** - Long-term rentals, 5+ unit buildings, commercial. (Currently undercounted - 2028 attestations will reveal these.)

## Results

As of January 2026:
- About 60% of parcels have positive dwelling signals
- About 40% have no evidence of a dwelling (woodland, vacant land, commercial)
- Roughly one-third of dwellings are homesteads

## Limitations

This methodology is conservative. We likely undercount:
- ADUs not in Grand List
- Recent construction not yet recorded
- Unpermitted dwellings (unless rented as STR)

The 2028 Act 73 attestations will provide verified ground truth.
