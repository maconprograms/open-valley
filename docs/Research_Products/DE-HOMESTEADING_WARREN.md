# De-Homesteading Warren

**Tracking the flow of primary residences in a Vermont ski town**

*Analysis of Vermont PTTR data, 2019-2025*

---

## The Core Finding

From 2019 to 2025, Warren experienced a **net loss of 24 homestead properties**—dwellings that were someone's primary residence becoming second homes or rentals.

This is slower than you might expect, but it's consistent: 5 of the last 7 years showed net de-homesteading.

---

## How We Measure This

The Vermont Property Transfer Tax Return (PTTR) captures two key pieces of information:

1. **Seller's state** — Was the seller a Vermont resident?
2. **Buyer's intended use** — What does the buyer plan to do with the property?

We define:
- **Loss**: VT seller → buyer declares "Secondary Residence" or "Non-Primary" use
- **Gain**: Any seller → buyer declares "Primary Residence" or "Domicile"

This measures actual changes in housing use, not just who owns what.

## The Numbers

### Net Homesteading by Year

| Year | Losses | Gains | Net | Status |
|------|--------|-------|-----|--------|
| 2019 | 30 | 34 | **+4** | Re-homesteading |
| 2020 | 41 | 32 | **-9** | De-homesteading |
| 2021 | 36 | 32 | **-4** | De-homesteading |
| 2022 | 20 | 12 | **-8** | De-homesteading |
| 2023 | 21 | 9 | **-12** | De-homesteading |
| 2024 | 27 | 23 | **-4** | De-homesteading |
| 2025 | 15 | 24 | **+9** | Re-homesteading |
| **Total** | **190** | **166** | **-24** | |

**Key Finding**: The COVID years (2020-2023) drove consistent de-homesteading. 2019 and 2025 actually showed gains.

## What's Actually Happening

### The Losses (190 properties)

These are confirmed de-homesteading events: a Vermont resident sold, and the buyer declared the property would NOT be their primary residence.

| Buyer's Declared Intent | Count |
|------------------------|-------|
| Secondary Residence | 162 |
| Non-Primary Year-Round | ~28 |

### The Gains (166 properties)

These are properties becoming primary residences—regardless of who the seller was.

| Buyer's Declared Intent | Count |
|------------------------|-------|
| Domicile/Primary Residence | 134 |
| Principal Residence | 35 |

### Who Buys Primary Residences?

| Buyer Origin | Purchases |
|-------------|-----------|
| Vermont residents | 156 (92%) |
| Out-of-state buyers | 13 (8%) |

**Key Finding**: Almost all primary residence buyers are already Vermonters. Out-of-state buyers rarely move here full-time—they buy second homes.

---

## The COVID Effect

2020-2023 were the worst years for de-homesteading:

| Period | Losses | Gains | Net |
|--------|--------|-------|-----|
| 2020-2023 | 118 | 85 | **-33** |

The pandemic triggered remote work, which made owning a ski house feasible for more people. But those buyers weren't moving to Vermont—they were adding Warren as a second location.

---

## Why This Matters

Warren's current homestead rate is **16.4%** (509 of 3,109 dwellings).

At -24 properties over 7 years, that's about **-3 to -4 homesteads per year** on average.

This is slower than "Warren is selling itself" but it's still directional: the year-round population is gradually shrinking.

### The Compounding Problem

Each lost homestead means:
- One fewer family in the school system
- One fewer volunteer for town committees
- One more property that's dark most of the year
- One more dwelling competing in the vacation rental market

At 16.4% homestead rate, Warren is already at a critical threshold. Even small annual losses matter.

## What the Data Can't Tell Us

### The "Other" Category

559 transfers were categorized as "other" intended use. These include:

| Description | Count |
|-------------|-------|
| Open Land | 200 |
| Other (unspecified) | 75 |
| Non-PR Year-Round | 64 |
| Non-PR Long-Term Rental | 37 |
| Timberland | 5 |

"Open Land" transfers (200) don't affect homestead counts—they're not dwellings.

### Pre-2019 Data

The PTTR data we have starts reliably in 2019. We can't measure how Warren got to 16.4%—that's the result of decades of this pattern.

### Rental Conversions

When a second home becomes a short-term rental (or vice versa), the PTTR doesn't capture that transition. The property was already non-homestead.

---

## Correcting Earlier Analysis

An earlier version of this report focused on **buyer origin** (Vermont vs out-of-state) and found 353 net properties went to out-of-state buyers.

That number is accurate but measures something different:
- **Ownership flow**: Who holds the deed
- **Housing use flow**: Whether the property is someone's home

A Massachusetts buyer purchasing a second home from another Massachusetts seller doesn't change Warren's homestead count. An out-of-state buyer who moves to Vermont full-time actually ADDS a homestead.

The **-24 net homesteading** figure is the correct measure of community impact.

---

## Policy Implications

### Act 73 (2024)

Vermont's new property tax law charges higher rates for non-homestead residential properties. The intent: make second-home ownership more expensive.

Will this slow de-homesteading? The data suggests:
- Losses are driven by Vermont sellers, not buyer behavior
- Gains depend on attracting primary-residence buyers
- Higher taxes on second homes might discourage some purchases, but won't create new residents

### What Would Actually Help

Based on this data:
1. **Retain Vermont sellers**: Why are VT residents selling? Economics? Inheritance? If sellers stayed, there'd be no loss.
2. **Convert buyers to residents**: 13 out-of-state buyers declared primary residence intent. Could this be higher?
3. **Protect existing homesteads**: Zoning, tax incentives, or restrictions that make keeping a homestead easier.

## Summary

Warren is de-homesteading, but slowly:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Net homestead loss (2019-2025) | -24 properties |
| Average annual loss | ~3-4 properties |
| Current homestead rate | 16.4% |
| Years of de-homesteading | 5 of 7 |

The COVID years accelerated the trend. 2025 shows early signs of reversal, but one year doesn't make a trend.

The question isn't whether Warren is changing—it is. The question is whether that change is acceptable, and if not, what to do about it.
