## Key Political Debates

### 1. School Budget Crisis (2024)

The most contentious period was Spring 2024, when HUUSD budgets failed multiple votes:

**Timeline:**
- Feb-March 2024: Initial budget fails
- May 2024: Revised budget presented
- May 30, 2024: Second budget vote
- June 2024: Governor Scott vetoes state education funding bill
- Legislature overrides veto despite protests

**Perspectives:**

*Critics (vote NO):*
- Gene Bifano: "Yep they heard it loud clear. They overrode the Governor's Veto of H887 with its 13.8% tax increase."
- Matt Lillard: "After multiple failed budgets our representatives had the chance to take our feedback and actually work with the governor... Instead they opt to kick the can down the road."
- Jeff Brouillard: "Vermont doesn't want us. Just the Uber wealthy and service workers are wanted here."

*Supporters (vote YES):*
- Kari Dolan: "I understand your frustration, I am frustrated too but please consider how the lack of budget affects our students, our teachers, and our schools. This new budget already eliminates languages and interventionists."
- Robin Lehman: "I've known for 50 years that property tax is a terrible way to fund education... I propose a strongly progressive income and wealth tax."

### 2. Climate Policy & Clean Heat Standard (S.5)

**Critics:**
- Donald Simonini: "Senate Bill 5... will raise your price of propane and oil an additional minimum of 70 cents per gallon up to $4 per gallon... The results of the implementation of this law will do no such thing [to curb climate change]."
- Gene Bifano: Labels climate bills as "disastrous" and "unrealistic"

**Advocates:**
- Sal Spinosa: Regular "Climate News" posts highlighting clean energy innovation
- Friends of the Mad River: Climate resilience programs

### 3. Town Garage Bond (Warren, Nov 2024)

$10 million, 30-year bond for new town garage:

**Critics:**
- Gene Bifano: "We've all seen ads from reputable steel companies offering 20,000 sq ft steel buildings for $250,000. Why should our 12,210 sq ft building cost $1.6 million?"
- Quayl Rewinski: "30 years is a LONG time! If you are 50 years old right now, you will be 80 when these bonds are paid off!"
- Sue Anne Stager: "The proposed town garage is very pretty. Do we REALLY need such a grand structure?"

**Supporters:**
- Win Smith: "I believe that our Select Board over the decades... have done a responsible job of keeping the rate down"

### 4. Affordable Housing Crisis

Widely acknowledged across political spectrum:

- Becky Cowan: "Trying to find affordable housing in the community for workers is so difficult nowadays"
- Donald Simonini (pro-wastewater): "Once the waste water system is in place, Waitsfield will be able to increase appropriate affordable housing density"
- Jane Kontoff: "There is a dire need in the Mad River Valley... for affordable housing"

**Tension Points:**
- Short-term rentals (STRs) blamed by some for reducing housing stock
- Development restrictions (Act 250) seen as barrier
- Property tax burden making ownership difficult
